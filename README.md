## About

This site will prdominately be written in Laravel (a PHP framework), but future development may branch into node.js frameworks such as VUE, which Laravel is natively
compatable with. ClubSocial is inteded to help the members of the club communicate with one another and recieve news about club updates and announcements.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from all club members at any time. Whether you're interested in coding, design, or bug reporting, your involvement is valuable to us.

### System Requirements

To work on this project, you'll need to have php installed on your computer. I reccomend this page to get you started: https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.windows.php
You will need to make a copy of the php.ini-development file included with your php install, and remove the -development part of the file extension. This "php.ini" serves
as your php configuration file.

_If you are on a windows machine, you will need to edit your system environment variables path to go to your php folder._

Inside of the php.ini, you'll need to remove the semicolon in front of the following:
* extension=curl
* extension=fileinfo
* extension=openssl
* extension=zip
* extension=pdo_mysql
* extension=pdo_sqlite
* extension=sqlite3

If you have any quesitons about the php install, email the repo's contact email.

### Pull Requests

### Site Design

For site design contributions, please ensure that your work adheres to the design guidelines provided in the designated directory within the project. We use Adobe XD for site design, but if you prefer other tools, there are free alternatives that are compatible with XD files.
